g|right|ready
g|ehm the diamond mine the the diamond mine is like just eh to the the the right of you there|explain
f|right i've got the diamond mine|acknowledge
f|i've got the start and the diamond mine|explain
g|right|acknowledge
g|now just go down beside the left-hand side of the diamond mine and eh just to below the words the first "d" there|instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|then draw a line ehm a kind of go from there eh to just below the "s" of springboks|instruct
f|don't have springboks|explain
g|you don't have that's right|acknowledge
g|ehm okay right|ready
g|in that case just draw a horizontal line to just below the eh to the the left of the "h" of highest viewpoint|instruct
f|horizontal|check
g|yes horizontal right|reply_y
f|hold on right|acknowledge
g|now we're going to go round eh highest viewpoint|instruct
g|okay|align
g|so eh|instruct
f|a curve or|check
g|it well we can do it in a well just go eh vertically up to the "h"|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
g|then make a curve round to the eh like a semicircle|instruct
g|right|align
f|okay|acknowledge
g|eh is there anything below there|query_w
f|there's the overgrown gully|reply_w
g|right|acknowledge
g|and eh what about safari truck|query_yn
f|yes i've got that|reply_y
g|now where's the overgrown gully|query_w
f|it's between highest viewpoint and the safari truck|reply_w
g|eh what the midway between them|check
f|yes|reply_y
g|and eh to the left or right of highest viewpoint|query_w
f|it's beneath it|reply_w
f|it's to the right-hand side|reply_w
g|it's directly beneath it|check
g|to the right-hand side of safari truck|acknowledge
f|slightly to the right-hand side|clarify
g|right of this one right okay|acknowledge
f|right to the middle of highest viewpoint anyway|clarify
g|okay right|acknowledge
g|so go on the outsides eh towards the paper edge ehm down to safari truck in a a slight curve|instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|and then eh draw a diagonal line ehm from there across the top of safari truck down to field station|instruct
f|that's on my map it's slightly above field station slightly above safari truck|explain
g|what is above that|query_w
f|above that's field station's on a level slightly above safari truck|reply_w
g|right|acknowledge
g|well mine's eh on the same level|explain
g|ehm it what what is there anything else that's in eh that's causing it to be up like that|query_w
f|well there's a banana tree directly below diamond mine|reply_w
g|right|acknowledge
f|it's slightly below safari truck slightly below the level of safari truck|reply_w
g|right okay|acknowledge
g|well eh you're just next to the eh that what was the object you've just drawn past|query_w
f|i've just drawn past the overgrown gully|reply_w
f|i'm now at the top right-hand corner of safari truck|explain
g|right|acknowledge
g|ehm well draw eh a kind of diagonal line and then turn it|instruct
f|up or down|query_w
g|eh from right to left eh downwards|clarify
g|eh underneath field station|instruct
f|right that's way over the the far left-hand side of the page on my map|explain
g|where is field station|query_w
f|field station's way over the far left|reply_w
g|it's the far uh|acknowledge
g|well there's two field stations on my map|explain
f|there's not one on mine|explain
g|right|acknowledge
g|so you've only got one there|check
f|yes|reply_y
g|and none there in the centre right|acknowledge
g|ehm in that case you want to draw the diagonal line and then|instruct
g|where is banana tree|query_w
f|banana tree is directly below diamond mine and it's slightly above the centre of the page|reply_w
g|right|acknowledge
g|so eh well draw this diagonal line down and then change it to a curve at the top level of banana tree and curve it round banana tree ehm with the apex of the curve pointing to the top right-hand corner sorry left-hand corner|instruct
f|right what was that again sorry|query_w
g|right|acknowledge
f|this pen's running out i think|explain
g|if you hold it eh vertically it'll come down|explain
f|it's gone|explain
f|ah right|acknowledge
g|is it okay now|check
f|yes|reply_y
g|right ehm right i'll just do the the bit at the safari truck right|explain
g|draw a diagonal line from where you were|clarify
g|right|align
f|right|reply_y
g|eh to the same just below the the level of the word safari truck and between banana tree and safari truck|clarify
f|okay|acknowledge
f|okay|acknowledge
g|which is slightly above eh banana tree|explain
f|right|acknowledge
g|right|acknowledge
g|then draw a curve over banana tree ehm and curving round on it|instruct
f|down the left-hand side|check
g|right|reply_y
g|and ehm now do you have gold mine between eh banana tree and rock fall at the bottom there|query_yn
f|no|reply_n
g|right|acknowledge
g|in that case eh well gold mine on my map is halfway between rock fall and banana tree|explain
f|okay|acknowledge
f|directly below|check
g|okay|align
g|it's directly below banana tree and directly above rock fall|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
g|and it's eh in the at the mid point of the two of that line|clarify
f|okay|acknowledge
g|right|align
g|so ehm i want you to come down to two thirds of the way between eh rock fall and banana tree have|instruct
f|is that two thirds beneath banana tree or two thirds up|check
g|two eh that's two third beneath banana tree|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
g|right ehm now there i want you to draw ehm a horizontal line to the left sorry to the right sorry eh to the right just eh so that you're on the other side of banana tree if you understand|instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|then the rope bridge can you see that on your map|query_yn
f|yes|reply_y
f|that's slightly above it's between where i am and banana tree roughly about halfway between|explain
g|between where you are and where|query_w
f|banana tree|reply_w
g|right well|acknowledge
f|it's on a line roughly between that it's over to the right-hand side of the page|clarify
g|right|acknowledge
g|ehm are crocodiles the other side of the thing|query_yn
f|yes|reply_y
g|yeah|acknowledge
g|ehm and eh the crocodile's to the right of the rope bridge|query_yn
f|yes|reply_y
g|right|acknowledge
f|to the right and below|clarify
g|right and below right|acknowledge
g|ehm what i want you to do is|instruct
g|is there anything between the eh between the where you are now and the rope bridge|query_yn
f|no|reply_n
g|right|acknowledge
g|i want you to draw a line up to the rope bridge|instruct
f|straight line|check
g|yes a straight line up to rope bridge so that you can cross the rope bridge the actual bridge drawing of the bridge right|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
g|now do you have giraffes at the bottom eh right-hand corner|query_yn
f|yes|reply_y
g|right|acknowledge
g|i want you to eh draw round the crocodile eh on the outside of the page down to giraffes|instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|right i want you to go underneath the giraffes|instruct
g|and there's any other obstacles there|query_yn
f|there's a disused warehouse at the bottom roughly about two a third of the way in from the right|reply_w
g|right|acknowledge
g|right|acknowledge
g|is it eh is it above great lake and below giraffes|query_yn
f|no|reply_n
f|it's to the right of great lake on a level with it|clarify
g|right|acknowledge
g|well in that case i want you to ehm eh curve slightly up to eh just go underneath the giraffes and eh to on a level with the the word giraffes and stop there|instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|right now i want you to eh go round the warehouse eh and under the great lake|instruct
g|by round i mean over like over the eh the warehouse|instruct
f|okay|acknowledge
f|right|acknowledge
g|right and then under the great lake|instruct
g|is there any other obstacles there|query_yn
f|no|reply_n
g|and then come up between eh|instruct
g|now it's the great lake and eh rock fall halfway between them but over to the left-hand side of the page is the finish point|explain
f|okay|acknowledge
g|right|acknowledge
