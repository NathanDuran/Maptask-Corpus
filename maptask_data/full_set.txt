g|draw to just before the boat house writing starts there right okay that's where i want you to be|instruct
f|what from the concealed hideout to the boat house|check
g|uh-huh|reply_y
f|so would it bypass the river|check
g|yeah|reply_y
g|i don't want you to go near the river at all|clarify
f|but i have to go near it to go to the boat house|explain
g|no i want you to go to the boat house on your right on your on your left|clarify
f|i don't have one on my left|explain
g|thought you did|explain
f|got one underneath the concealed hideout|explain
g|well i've got one i've got one to the left of the concealed hideout|explain
f|what the other side of the page|check
g|uh-huh|reply_y
f|oh no mine's is underneath the concealed hideout|explain
g|have you drawn down to there|query_yn
f|no|reply_n
g|good|acknowledge
g|right imagine you've got a boat house to the left of the concealed hideout|instruct
g|right|ready
g|do you see where in can you see crane bay|align
f|mmhmm|reply_y
g|do you see where there's where the coastline comes round it's um there's a sort of like jutting out bit there's like a point|align

g|okay|acknowledge
g|i want you to|instruct
g|you see where it comes down like that|align
f|mmhmm|reply_y
g|well i want you to follow follow the line of the the coast there|instruct
g|so draw from concealed hideout vertically downwards 'til you come to that jutting out bit of the coastline then until until on that incline draw you know follow the line of the coast but don't don't go on to crane bay until you come to the the next bit that comes up okay stop there|instruct

f|done that|acknowledge
g|right and from there it's a straight line to another line which is ehm level with the top of the picket fence and the furthest most part of east lake that bulge that goes out the left-hand side|instruct
f|mmhmm|acknowledge
f|so sorry say that again|query_w
g|on a eh the finish point is on a line level with the picket fence|clarify
f|mmhmm|acknowledge
g|about the middle of the picket fence and a vertical line that touches the outer the left most part of east lake|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
f|actually touches the|check
g|it doesn't eh doesn't actually touch the east lake|clarify
f|no|acknowledge
f|right|acknowledge
f|think that's where it is|explain
g|start top of the extinct volcano|instruct
g|it's the bottom right-hand corner of the map|explain
f|oh|acknowledge
g|but it's marked well|explain
f|okay|acknowledge
f|i was looking at the top|explain
g|have you found it|align
f|yeah it's okay|reply_y
g|right and if you move maybe one and a half centimetres from the top of there to the left|instruct
f|mmhmm|acknowledge
g|and stop|instruct
f|is that horizontally|check
g|horizontally yeah sorry|reply_y
f|okay|acknowledge
g|and then go down vertically about maybe five centimetres so you're actually below the extinct volcano you go down the left-hand side of it|instruct
f|pen's not working there that's done it okay|explain
g|and stop about you're there|instruct
g|then you go horizontally left|instruct
g|have you got a tribal settlement|query_yn
f|no|reply_n
g|that's in the bottom left-hand corner of the map|explain
f|mm|acknowledge
g|it's just a bit below the extinct volcano but sort just about the same level but the opposite side|explain
g|so you go from that point where you stopped|instruct
f|okay|acknowledge
f|mmhmm|acknowledge
g|along to the left-hand corner of the map to about one and a half centimetres from the edge|instruct
f|just in a horizontal line|check
g|horizontal line straight across|reply_y
f|okay do i have to do anything to avoid the the settlement|check
g|well if you if you go if you're just below the extinct volcano just now a bit below it|reply_w
f|uh-huh|acknowledge
g|you can go straight along and you'll be underneath the tribal settlement|reply_w
f|okay|acknowledge
f|how far away from the edge of the paper|query_w
g|one and a half centimetres|clarify
f|okay|acknowledge
g|stop|instruct
f|just get my ruler out|explain
g|have you got a rope bridge|query_yn
f|yeah|reply_y
g|if you go straight up the left-hand side of where the tribal settlement would be 'til you're ehm just maybe below the rope bridge but like in a straight line so you're not absolutely underneath it but you're to the left-hand side of it because it curves round over onto the rope bridge|instruct
g|you know what i mean|align
f|mmhmm|reply_y
g|so|ready
f|okay|ready
f|so i i go upwards like the same distance away from the paper|check
g|upwards for about|clarify
f|the edge of the paper until i'm just across from the rope bridge|check
g|yeah|reply_y
g|no|reply_n
g|'til you've maybe one centimetre below it and then you sort of curve round|clarify
f|below the writing of rope bridge|check
g|no|reply_n
f|below|acknowledge
g|below|clarify
g|do you the left-hand side of the rope bridge|clarify
f|uh-huh|acknowledge
g|but you don't go a straight line and then turn you curve round onto the rope bridge|clarify
f|okay|acknowledge
f|so i'm going to cross the rope bridge yeah|check
g|yes you|reply_y
f|okay|acknowledge
g|are you crossing the rope bridge|align
f|you want me to cross it uh-huh|check
g|well if you curve round slightly and cross the rope bridge|clarify
f|okay|acknowledge
g|and then stop when you get to the other side|instruct
f|uh-huh|acknowledge

f|do you have a machete|query_yn
g|no i don't|reply_n
g|where's the machete|query_w
f|it's to the right and just down|reply_w
g|from the rope bridge|query_yn
f|it's to it's about three centimetres to the right and just down from the rope bridge|reply_w
f|so if i if i curve down and and go underneath where that is is that okay|query_yn
g|is that curving down a lot|query_yn
g|'cause it's only about one and a half centimetres two centimetres you've got to curve down|explain
f|mmhmm|acknowledge
f|well where would i go once i curve down on your map|query_w
g|you turn right and go straight across so you're you're about three centimetres above the start position|reply_w
f|okay that's fine|acknowledge
f|i'll just go underneath it then|explain

g|and stop there|instruct
g|no|reply_n
g|straight line up to the left-hand side of collapsed shelter so you're on the level with the top of saxon barn but not actually near it you're still on the right-hand side of the map|clarify
f|so it's a it is a diagonal upwards towards the|check
g|no|reply_n
g|straight line upwards|clarify
f|well i can't do that|explain
g|why not|query_w
f|'cause my saxon barn's on the|reply_w
g|no you go straight up the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter|clarify
f|uh-huh|acknowledge

f|have you got a crevasse|query_yn
g|no|reply_n
f|well have you got anything to the right of the saxon barn|query_w
g|no|reply_n
g|so if you go straight up would you curve round the crevasse to get to the saxon barn|query_yn
f|if i went a bit to the right i could just go straight up|reply_w
f|would that be okay|query_yn
g|if you go well i was going|reply_w
f|so i'd be on like a horizontal line with the saxon barn yeah|check

f|say that again|query_w
f|i'm on just now i'm on a horizontal line just beside above the saxon barn|explain
g|but not right over it|check
f|no|reply_n
f|i'm not beside it yet|explain
g|no right|acknowledge
g|ehm so you would|clarify
g|ehm is where's the crevasse from there is it underneath you|query_yn
f|it's just beside me just now it's just to my right like if i if i went sorry if i went to my left i would pass the crevasse and i would pass the saxon barn|reply_w
g|right|acknowledge

f|going southwest|check
g|going southwest|reply_y
f|to finish under the second beech tree i would have to go southeast if i only moved over one inch to the east in the first movement because you said two inches|explain
g|well make it one and a half inch sorry one and a half inch east|clarify
f|what's one and a half|query_w
g|you what you want to do is you want to clear the eh first movement round the chapel will have to clear the beech trees and then come down again to under the first ts on the right-hand beech tree|clarify
